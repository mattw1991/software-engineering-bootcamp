# software-engineering-bootcamp
Final project on CoGrammar Python Software Engineering Bootcamp

This program is designed to make use of user.txt and tasks.txt which are also in this folder. It is a task management system - some of the code was provided as part of the task and the functions were written by me. Users can add a new username, add a task, reassign tasks to another user, view all tasks, view their own tasks, generate reports, and, in the case of "admin" account, display these reports in the terminal. If you would like to test this, please download all three files into the same directory, run the Python file in a terminal, and log in initially with username "admin" and username "password". Pull requests also feature as part of another task on this course.
